# New Architecture causes pre-splash crash on standalone APK

## The rule
**Set `newArchEnabled: false` in app.json** for any AfuChat standalone APK build until all JSI/TurboModule native deps are proven stable on New Arch.

**Why:**
With `newArchEnabled: true`, React Native initializes all JSI modules (react-native-worklets, react-native-nitro-modules, react-native-mmkv) via TurboModule JNI **before** the Hermes JS bundle executes. If any of these JNI `nativeInstall()` calls fail (version mismatch, missing .so, bad initialization order), the app crashes **before the splash screen ever shows**. The crash is invisible to JS error handlers.

In Expo Go these modules are ABSENT (Expo Go has its own worklet/mmkv runtime), so the crash never appears there — making it a standalone-only crash that is very hard to attribute.

With `newArchEnabled: false`, JSI modules initialize lazily on first JS call. The app boots and shows the splash screen. If a module crashes, it happens in JS context where error boundaries and try/catch can handle it.

**How to apply:**
- Any time the APK crashes before the splash screen appears on a real device but works in Expo Go → first try `newArchEnabled: false`
- Do NOT re-enable New Arch without testing ALL of: react-native-worklets, react-native-mmkv, react-native-nitro-modules, react-native-track-player on the target RN + Expo SDK version combination

## EAS account issue (noted Jun 2026)
A previous agent changed `app.json` `owner` to `"afume"` and the EAS `projectId` to `363a3c64-5a90-4aae-86b5-aa54014921ef`. The robot token `DMMpaEjJw_...` only has access to the `afuchat` account / project `784a87ad-e3d1-438c-9c84-1b336f4fd2d2`. Always verify owner + projectId match the token account before submitting a build.
