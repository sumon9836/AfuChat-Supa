# Patch: react-native-worklets SoLoader try-catch.
# WorkletsModule has a static { SoLoader.loadLibrary("worklets"); } block that runs
# when the class is first loaded (New Architecture, during early JS init). If libworklets.so
# fails to load (ABI mismatch, linker error, missing dep), it throws UnsatisfiedLinkError
# which escapes the Java exception handler and crashes the whole JVM before any JS error
# handler can catch it. Wrapping in try-catch degrades gracefully: Reanimated will
# report a JS error (caught by ErrorBoundary) instead of a silent native crash.
