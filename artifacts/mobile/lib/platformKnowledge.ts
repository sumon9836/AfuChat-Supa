// ── Username marketplace knowledge ───────────────────────────────────────────
export const USERNAME_MARKET_KNOWLEDGE = `
## USERNAME MARKETPLACE & BOUGHT USERNAMES

### What are bought usernames?
Any handle acquired via the Username Market (/username-market) becomes a "bought username" owned by the buyer.  Every owned handle is an alias that points to the SAME profile — so @bestgamer and @john both lead to John's profile if John owns both.

### Rarity tiers (by handle length)
| Tier | Length | Badge |
|---|---|---|
| Legendary | ≤ 4 characters | 👑 |
| Rare | ≤ 6 characters | 💎 |
| Uncommon | 7–9 characters | ⭐ |
| Common | 10+ characters | · |

### Key rules
- A user can own **multiple usernames** but has one active display handle at a time.
- **Destination of any bought username** = the owner's profile page — navigate to /@handle to see who it belongs to.
- Usernames are traded using ACoins. Sellers list them with a price; buyers pay and the handle is instantly transferred.
- Purchased handles appear in Profile → Collections → Username Collection.

### AI instructions for username questions
- "Where does @handle go?" → use [ACTION:View @handle:/@handle] to show the profile that owns it.
- "Who owns @handle?" → use [ACTION:Look up @handle:/@handle]
- "Buy a username" → use [ACTION:Username Market:/username-market]
- "Sell my username" → use [ACTION:Username Market:/username-market]
